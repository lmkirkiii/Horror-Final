          <p> Hello <span class="name"> </span> you are being haunted by a Snapchat ghost! Based on the fact that your birthday is <span class="birth"> </span> that you will be taken over by the Snapchat ghost soon. We know that your cat has the best name of <span class="cat"></span> and for this we love you! All we can say is that you will need <span class="celebrity"></span> to delete all social media and throw away all of your technology for your own protection. You will probably see random faces when you use filters in your snapchat. Your tv or phone may glitch periodically. Because you are a <span class="zodiac"></span>, you are more susceptable to having a Snapchat ghost attach themselves to you. The Snapchat ghost always knows how to kill you... using simply the concept of <span class="fun"></span> Obvioulsy you will be haunted if you ever visit this location: <span class="camp"></span>. I want you to know that this is going to be the ride of your lifetime similar to <span class="roller-coaster"></span> If you deny this fact you will be taken over by the Snapchat ghost who will look like <span class= "alive"></span> . Your best option is to ask it questions and hope they dont want to kill you...  </p>

          <h3> Get married as soon as possible</h3>
          <h5 class="story3">Hello <span class="name"></span>. It looks like you are mostly not haunted based on the asnwers you provided us. Since you said you were born on <span class="birth"></span> and the name of your ugly cat is, <span class="cat"></span>  we kinda think that you are not close to be attacked by ghosts. But that is not yet the overall conclusion, because on the other side you also said that your zodiac sign is <span class="zodiac"></span> and the <span class="camp"></span> you want to be murdered is such a good combination to ghosts to completly abandon you and not haunt you. It is all because, you are easy to be haunted with just a small effort of your favorite evil foce <span class="evil"></span>. So do not panic, you will be haunted anyway, It's too late to worry now. what you could do just to be safe is, to get married at this old haunted house. The photo is just a reminder. I wrote this, cause I am practising sarcasm with friends.</h5><br>
          <h5>Yours truly,</h5>
          <h5>Least worried about your haunting, Semhar.</h5><br>
